codonpair
=========

This is an archive with code to calculate codon pair score and bias. CPS
values are close, but not identical, with those produced by the perl
script. This requires further investigation to figure out the differences.
As a result, 2 of the regression tests don't pass.

## Installation

* Clone repo

```shell
git clone git@github.com:smsaladi/codonpair.git
```

* Install with `pip`

```shell
cd codonpair
pip install .
```

* If you've already installed the package and want to reinstall, try

```shell
pip install . -I
```

All dependencies should be checked for and, if necessary, installed
automatically by `pip`.
